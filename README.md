# Mahamadou Touray's Portfolio

Assigned to my software engineering boot camp as our first official React based project. We were instructed to create our own portfolio website using React JS to create-react app showcasing our various skills, experience, projects and contact to viewers. Multitude of functional components to render the content mainly through the About and App jsx files. Use of basic CSS, inline CSS and HTML tags within files.Each component assigned it own CSS file. Project consists of only a single page with no routing, instead a feature that allows users to toggle to a specific section of the webpage.
